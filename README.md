**BASIC IDEA BEHIND A VIDEO CONFRENCE APP AND THINGS YOU NEED TO DEVELOP THE APP:**

- Create your Express js server ->  Express is a minimalist web framework for Node.js â€” Express makes it very easy to create and run a web server with `Node.Js`.
- Show your Video-Audio to the app -> Using JavaScript `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`, etc.. 
- Then sett up rooms --> using uuid library we were able to generate random unique RoomId(URL) for each room.
- Stream others Video & Audio -->  using Socket.io and PeerJs. In short, Socket.io allows us to communicate between a client and a server. and peer.js implements WebRTC. 
    - "https://socket.io/" & "https://peerjs.com/" & "https://webrtc.org/" 
- Sytling the page with CSS. 
- Added The user interfaces .ejs 
- decide what functions you want to use: mute, stop video, etc... 
- Extras
     - login-signup Interfaces added 
     - Used Mongoose npm and passport Mongos to provide a schema to our verification, Mongos provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.
     - Used Mongoose dB to store data, 
- Publishing to Online Deployed our app to Heroku host services: we Tried different host services like Azure, Heroku and Vultr, it doesn't matter what host server you go with.  


**This app uses:**
- Node js - peer js - socket io - uuid - express - passport - mongoose - npm
