    to install npm 
    `npm install` 

    to be able to use the database: Don't forget to add the .env  of mongo_URI in the same folder of server.js
    `MONGO_URI= mongodb+srv://DtaBaseName:DdPass@cluster0.njkga.mongodb.net/DtaBaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority` 

    Finally, to run the app: 
    `npm run devStart` or ` node server.js`

    go to your borwser: at http://localhost:3000/ and now have a local hosted web app.
     
    To Deploy The app: we used Heroku & azure but you can use anyother like AWS,GCP up to you.

**BASIC IDEA BEHIND A VIDEO CONFRENCE APP AND tHING YOU NEED TO DEVELOP THE APP:**

- Create your Express js server ->  Express is a minimalist web framework for Node.js â€” Express makes it very easy to create and run a web server with `Node.Js`.
- Show your Video-Audio to the app -> Using JavaScript `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`, etc.. 
- Then sett up rooms --> using uuid libary we were able to generate random unique RoomId(URL) for each room.
- Stream others Video & Audio -->  using Socket.io and PeerJs. In short, Socket.io allows us to commincaute between a client and a server. and peer js implements WebRTC. 
    - "https://socket.io/" & "https://peerjs.com/" & "https://webrtc.org/" 
- Sytling the page with CSS. 
- Added The user interfaces .ejs 
- decide what functions you want to use: mute, stop video, etc... 
- Extras
     - login-signup Interfaces dded 
     - Used Mongoose npm and passport Mongoes to provide a schema to our verifiacation, Mongoes provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.
     - Used Mongoose db to store data, 
- Publishing to Online Deployed our app to Heroku host services: we Tried differnt host servises like Azure, heroku and Vultr, it doesn't matter what host server you go with.  


**This app uses:**
- Node js - peer js - socket io - uuid - express - passport - mongoose - npm
